👋 Hello, I'm Alba Prado Fernández
I'm a Full Stack Developer from Oviedo, Spain, with a strong background in Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and React. I combine solid backend development with modern frontend skills and a keen eye for UX/UI design, creating functional and user-friendly web applications.

I’ve also worked in graphic design, editorial production, and technical support, giving me a well-rounded perspective on digital projects.

🚀 I'm currently developing a personal Full Stack E-commerce project, which I’m sharing step-by-step on GitHub as it evolves. I enjoy working on clean, maintainable code and am always exploring new technologies and best practices.
